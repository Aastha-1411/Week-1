# Week-1
# Waste Material Classification  

## Overview  
This project focuses on classifying waste materials into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. The dataset is structured into two subfolders, representing the two classes. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of both static and dynamic visualizations for distribution analysis.  

## Features
**- Data Collection:**
  Dataset is taken from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data
  
**- Data Preprocessing:**
  Efficiently loaded and labeled image data from structured folders (TRAIN\O and TRAIN\R). Applied a mapping function to enhance label clarity.  
  
**- Visualization:** 
  - Static Pie Chart: A visually enhanced pie chart with title, legend, and custom colors for better readability.  
  - Dynamic Pie Chart: Created using Plotly for interactivity, with hover tooltips displaying percentages and labels. The image of dynamic chart is uploded.

## Key Improvements  
- Automated label mapping for scalability and clarity.  
- Enhanced pie chart aesthetics with titles, legends, and custom colors.  
- Added an interactive pie chart for dynamic exploration of data.  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.  
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive charts.  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image loading and processing.
